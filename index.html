		<h2>Recent projects</h2>
		<p> On the side, I'm interested in adding dplyr-like functionality to D3 (and Observable). I'm also trying be a better data modeler and to contribute to the <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan project</a>. But these are some things further along than that.</p>
		<h5><a href="https://github.com/d3">Improving D3-color and adding new D3 color modules</a></h5>
		<p>I've been added as a contributor to D3.js to add new color modules, based on newer percentually uniform color spaces not yet available in D3's color library. A beta of the first module, <a href="https://github.com/petulla/d3-hsluv">d3-hsluv</a>, is on Github. I'm workign on a second module, CIECAM16, with <a href="https://github.com/connorgr">Connor Gramazio.</a></p>
		<h5><a href="https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder/tree/mapbuilder">Maps + Chartbuilder</a></h5>
		<p>I built a way to render US, world, county and district choropleth and cartogram maps into Chartbuilder working in partnership with Quartz.</p>
		<h5><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president">NBC News Election Results</a></h5>
		<p>I oversaw visualization design and development for the NBC News's election results pages. We presented national Presidential, House, Senate and governors races. We build a server-side implementation of D3 for Node and Slackbots to optimize the process.</p>
		<h5><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tv/fox-news-cnn-msnbc-megyn-kelly-steve-kornacki-035013993.html">D3.js on TV (election night)</a></h5>
		<p>NBC News and MNSBC used D3.js to render maps on election night. I created an initial prototype to spur the idea for the product and managed a contractor who helped us build the app that ran election night.<a href="https://twitter.com/spetulla/status/796167494092419072">A few screengrabs here.</a></p>

		<h2>NBC News graphic articles</h2>

		<p>An easy way to find my latest articles is to search google, with the domain restricted and my name as the query. </p>
