		<p>I shared a byline on a recent NBC News project about the future of the Democratic party. I analyzed data to shape the piece's editorial direction, designed visualizations, wrote regression and Bayesian models and developed front-end code.</p>
		<h5><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/specials/donald-trump-republican-party">United States of Trump</a></h5>
		<p>I led data analysis and designed visualizations for this feature NBC News project from the 2016 election. The proejct won New York Press Club Award and Shorty Awards, among others. I composed dozens of models and created all visualizations for the first chapter, which led the piece.</p>
		<h5><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/specials/election-voting-ballot">Life of a Ballot</a></h5>
		<p>An NBC News mobile epxeriment. I helped lead the concept, development and design and reported out and wrote the story with a colleague.</p>
		<h5><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/interactives/geography-of-poverty/index.html">Geography of Poverty</a></h5>
		<p>I oversaw all data analysis, visualizations and code for the first 5 parts of this series. The project has many visual elements and interactives. My favorite chapter is the South and the introduction. The project had an updating interactive map fed the Instagram API.</p>
		<h5><a href="http://storysmith-trump-coalition.herokuapp.com/specials/trump-coalition">Trump Coalition</a></h5>

		<h2>Recent projects</h2>
		<h5>Quick Sketch Visuals App</h5>
		<p>It's not public yet but I am currently working on a Node.js app for quickly sketching and generating graphics. Similar to NPR's graphics rig, the project outputs static and interactive assets for embedding into a CMS. The project is designed with websockets and maintains state to make the development process reactive.</p>
		<h5><a href="https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder/tree/mapbuilder">Mapbuilder + Chartbuilder</a></h5>
		<p>I'm working in partnership with Quartz on their next Chartbuilder React app to support maps and diagrams. Upcoming release will be at the linked branch. Code converts Chartbuilder to ES2015 JS is optimized with BSTs.</p>
		<h5><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president">NBC News Election Results</a></h5>
		<p>I oversaw the visualizations and design styles on the NBC News results pages, which included national Presidential, House, Senate and all state races. I contributed to a novel implementation of D3.js that rendered server-side, developed on NBCNews.com's Node.js app, built slackbots and collaborative tools, and contributed to our AP API integration.</p>
		<h5><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tv/fox-news-cnn-msnbc-megyn-kelly-steve-kornacki-035013993.html">D3.js on TV (election night)</a></h5>
		<p>NBC News and MNSBC used D3.js to render maps on election night. I led an initial pitch for the concept and was a manager of its implementation. <a href="https://twitter.com/spetulla/status/796167494092419072">Additional screengrabs here.</a></p>
